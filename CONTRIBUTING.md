# Contributing / development

(written by @strajk, for @strajk â€“ after a year of not working on this project and coming back)

- no building, no bundling, extension works as is in `extension` folder
  - let's keep it that way! let's avoid webpack for as long as possible
- all features are in `extension/pages/options.js`
- auto-reloading somehow works in Chrome, but honestly, I don't know how :D
  - maybe it only works when `chrome://extensions/` is opened?
